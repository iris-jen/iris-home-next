        ive deleted alot of acounts over the years and seem to lost alot of the media i had from it :(
      </p>

      <p>And some schematics. I was using and arduino for all the control logic.
        i didnt really have any method for programming the movments other than guessing angles lol.
        the servos i bought had the wiper pin of the pot inside brought out on a seperate wire. so i used that as an analog input.
        i basicly set up a record function and moved the motors to where i wanted them. then saved the motions into a sequence, and used
        it for forward walk, backwards walk, strafe, turns etc. it fell over alot :).

        I wired up a raspbery pi and used it as a web interface to make the robot walk around. i had four buttons for directions. simple shit.
        it was part of project for a microcontrollers class which i put way to much effor into lmao
        i miss it. one day i will bring it back to life.

      />

      <p>Pulled from the report. i had ambitions of ditching the arduino and just using a bunch of ADCs and a i2c servo controler on the pi~~~
      next probable schematic is a fucking silly title. lol like am i randomly generating them?
