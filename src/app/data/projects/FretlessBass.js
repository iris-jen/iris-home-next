      <p>I ended up breaking the truss rodd in my 5 string while i was trying to make some adjustments</p>
      <p>Sucks, but lesson learned, dont fucking over torque things lmao</p>

      <p>Anyways, i ordered a new neck off ebay from some rando seller. was considering warrick or another custom fab,
        but i did not want to spend more than $150 on a new neck ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

      <p>SO WE ROLLED THE DICE ON MYSTERY NECK WITH NO MEASURMENTS OR INFORMATION LISTED OTHER THAN IT MIGHT FIT A 5 STRING JAZZ BASS BODY LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO üé≤</p>

      <p>new neck is in the bottom of the photo there, old one on top</p>

      <p>Mostly fit into the pocket, but it was a tad to small on the sides.
        i ended up shimming it with cut up mountain dew cans on each side of the neck when it sits in the body and it works lmao.
        the shape of the bottom of the neck did not match the mating side on the body. so i just sanded it by eye till it roughly did :)</p>

      <p>Piloted the mounting holes, screwed the neck on, slapped some strings on that bad boy, did a quick check 
        and the frets cut the living shit out of my hands :(</p>
      <p>I could have filed down the frets, but ive been mising playing fretless bass.
        i had one years and years ago but i sold it for travel money at the time lol</p>
